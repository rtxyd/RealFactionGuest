# Preview

In rimworld, There is an issue where pawns that come in event or quests are forcibly changed to vanilla pawns type even though they are mod factions.

* This mod solves event / quest pawn issues for 
all of mod human/non-human factions, vanilla expended faction, races added as human alien races, and races added as garam races.

* So you can meet real faction pawns added as mods in various situations.



# Compatible

- Saved Game Compatible (Only new Event or Quest)



# Incompatible

- Empire mod



**Please take this mod and modify it. The source code is included.
I'd love to see variations come out with various ideas.
I'm a game designer, and I haven't implemented many ideas yet due to lack of time.
If you are proficient in C# and are interested, please contact me on the rimworld discord.**
