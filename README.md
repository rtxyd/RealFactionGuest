This is a forked version of real faction guest, I rewrite most of it's code. So I forked it.
What's new:
1. this version makes human don't get wrong alien backstory, and alien will not get wrong backstory (They can all get vanilla backstories)
2. hmmmm, maybe less issues.

# Preview

In rimworld, There is an issue where pawns that come in event or quests are forcibly changed to vanilla pawns type even though they are mod factions.

* This mod solves event / quest pawn issues for 
all of mod human/non-human factions, vanilla expended faction, races added as human alien races, and races added as garam races.

**Please take this mod and modify it. The source code is included.
I'd love to see variations come out with various ideas.
I'm a game designer, and I haven't implemented many ideas yet due to lack of time.
If you are proficient in C# and are interested, please contact me on the rimworld discord.**
