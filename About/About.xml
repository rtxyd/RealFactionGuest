This is a forked version of [1.5] Real Faction Guest (Continued) , I rewrite almost all of its code and expand the features. So I forked it (packageID is different, you don't need to unsubscribe Mlie's version, and don't load both of them).

New Features
1. Add modsetting now!
2. This version implement a filter to make every pawn get right backstory.
So human will not get random alien backstories, and aliens will not get mismatched backstories. Trying to make them be "real" faction guest.

Something you need to know (not issues):
* alien can get vanilla backstories sometimes, and will not get backstories of other alien races.

* (fixed) randomized pawn will not trigger the filter, I will look into this later.

Mlie's version is still active

DON'T USE THEM THE SAME TIME
