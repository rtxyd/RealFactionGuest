This is a forked version of real faction guest (Continued), I rewrite most of it's code comparing to Mlie's continued version. So I forked it (packageID is different, you don't need to unsubscribe Mlie's version, and don't load both of them), you don't need use this version since they have same function, unless you get issue with Mlie's version or just you want to.

Source code is here or for reporting issues
